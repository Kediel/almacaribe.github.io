        <br>
        I have a published paper in the Privacy domain found

        <br>
        In my spare time I sail boats, try to surf, occasionally snowboard, carve around on my surf skate and follow the jazz giants.
        After participating in CTFs I help manage the NYU OSIRIS lab Infrastructure.
        When I am not focused on cyber or having fun I am the owner of Alma Caribe, a private investment club.
        <br>
        I am a Drexel University Graduate and current NYU Cyber Fellow.
        For a copy of my resume please inquire at chief1647@almacaribe.co or PM me on LinkedIn.
        For OSIRIS lab issues email k3ma5@osiris.cyber.nyu.edu.

        Looking forward to connecting! Stay safe, healthy and take it easy!
