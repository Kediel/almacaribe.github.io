    <h1>Alma Caribe LLC - Notice of EU Privacy Policy</h1>
    <!-- Intro -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Alma Caribe, LLC (the "Portfolio Manager") is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the confidentiality and security of your personal information. Any personal information processed by the Portfolio Manager is controlled by the Portfolio Manager, and the Portfolio Manager is the data controller of your personal information. When your details are provided to the Portfolio Manager as a consequence of your investment (or potential investment) in a private investment fund sponsored by Alma Caribe, LLC (each, a "Fund"), then the Portfolio Manager, acting as a data controller, may itself (or through a third party such as TastyWorks and Gemini (the "Administrator") acting in its capacity as the Fund's administrator) process your personal information or, if you are an entity, that of your (i) beneficial owner(s), (ii) employees, and (iii) directors, officers, trustees, general partners, managers, or other persons serving in a similar capacity (as distinguished from the entity itself) (the foregoing collectively, "Your Personal Information"). When processing Your Personal Information, the Administrator may also act as a data controller.

      This policy (the "GDPR Privacy Policy") explains the manner in which the Portfolio Manager collects, utilizes, and maintains nonpublic personal information about investors and potential investors ("Investors") based in the European Union ("EU") or the European Economic Area ("EEA"), as required under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR"). This EU Privacy Policy applies to your investment or potential investment in the Fund.

      Countries Having Access to Your Personal Information

      The Portfolio Manager also has service providers whose personnel will have access to Your Personal Information and that are located in other jurisdictions. Transfers to these service providers are necessary for the performance of the contract between the Portfolio Manager and the Investor. These jurisdictions either (i) afford an adequate level of protection for Your Personal Information (as declared by the European Commission) or, (ii) if they do not, then the Portfolio Manager has entered into agreements with these service providers incorporating clauses that are the same as or substantially similar to the standard contractual clauses, as well as other relevant provisions contained in the GDPR, and impose obligations no less onerous than those contained in this EU Privacy Policy.
